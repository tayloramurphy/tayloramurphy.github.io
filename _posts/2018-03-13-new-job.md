After nearly four and a half years at Concert Genetics, I moved on to a new position. I'm at GitLab working as a Data Engineer on their BizOps project. I'm very excited about the opportunity and have really enjoyed my time at the company since starting on January 29.

I wanted to reflect a bit on the advice I gave in an earlier post about what worked and didn't work for me. My secret when writing that post was that I was myself looking for a new position, but I had to frame aas a conversation with another person. The conversation really did happen in real life, but I was also sharing my own strategy for job hunting.

_Create a Portfolio_ : C-
I didn't have much of a portfolio initially. Most of my code wasn't open source and since I wasn't _really_ on the engineering side of things I wasn't able to contribute as much as I'd like. I did have my blog, some kaggle competitions, and some GitHub contributions, but it wasn't what I would consider impressive or reflective of what I wanted to do.

_Work on Projects, not Books_: B
I was working my way through the fast.ai course and I found it to be a useful way to learn and showcase my skill. The course was advanced for the jobs I was applying for, but it showed interest in the field.

_Write a Blog_: B-
I wrote two posts while job hunting. Applying for jobs is a lot of work. I was spending a lot of time writing in the mornings and evenings researching jobs, writing cover letters, and tweaking my resume. After I got the job I didn't write as much, but I want to change that.

_Apply even if you aren't perfect_ : A
I applied to a lot of jobs (close to 40 I think). With each one (after an couple of false starts) I took a look at the requirements and crafted my resume and cover letter to the specific job. Most of the jobs I applied to were Data Science and Data Engineering jobs, with a few Data Manager jobs thrown in. Some I met <50% of the requirements, but I felt like I could learn on the job. Some I knew there was no chance I'd get the position, but I threw a line out anyways because I'd rather they tell me know than me. 

_Don't be desperate_ : A+
I really honed this skill when I was first looking for a job after graduate school.

Things I would add:
* When applying remote, aim a little below your current skill level
* Pay some money for good design for your cover letter and resume
  * Don't lead with your education background - what can you DO for the company
* Get fucking lucky
